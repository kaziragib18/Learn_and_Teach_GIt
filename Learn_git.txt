Learn How to handle git and github.

Difference bwtween git and github,

Git: A version control system for tracking changes in files, code and managing project history. It works locally on your machine. For example that I showed,

git init, git add . , git commit -m "Your commit massage"

GitHub: A platform that hosts Git repositories online, allowing for collaboration, code sharing, and project management. For example that I showed,

git remote add origin https://github.com/Kaziragib18/Lean_and_Teach_Git.git
git push -u origin master

You add the GitHub repository as a remote and push your local commits to it.


The git checkout -b command is used to create a new branch and immediately switch to it in Git. Here's what it does:

-b: This flag tells Git to create a new branch.

<branch-name>: The name you specify for the new branch. For example,
git checkout -b feature-branch

Important note, always make sure where you are creating branch from. If you create branch from main but you are on the feature-branch and create a new branch from there it will inharit the feature-branch code not main branch code.

# You're on 'main'
git checkout -b new-branch

If you're on a feature branch and create a new branch, it will inherit the state of the feature branch.

# You're on 'feature-branch'
git checkout -b new-feature-branch

Always be mindful of which branch you're on when creating a new branch.

If you want to create a branch from a specific branch (like main), either check out main first or explicitly reference it when creating the new branch. So use this to spacify the exact source branch,

git checkout -b <new-branch-name> <source-branch>
